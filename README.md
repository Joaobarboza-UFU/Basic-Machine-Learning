# Machine-Learning

This repository stores the codes developed for the machine learning discipline at federal university of uberlandia. Each code it's going to be developed in the 
programming language that I judged the easier for the problem set.

# Hebbrule.c

Implementation of the hebb rulo to learn bipolar expressions like [-1, -1, 1, 1] , similar to binary expressions , but instead of having 0 and 1s , it has -1 and 1s. The code 
was developed to show the failure of the hebb rule when it tries to learn the bipolar expressions similar to XOR and XNOR. The code accepts the input using argv , so when run the code , run like this > ./Hebbrule 1 -1 1 -1
